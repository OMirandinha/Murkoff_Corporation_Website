# Murkoff Corporation Official Website

A passion project inspired by the Outlast universe, my goal is to create an interactive website for the Murkoff Corporation that captures both its corporate façade and the unsettling atmosphere of its hidden operations.

This project aims to recreate a sleek, modern, and functional corporate site — as if Murkoff really had a public presence. While the design emphasizes professionalism and trustworthiness on the surface, subtle visual cues and interactions hint at the darker truths beneath the company's polished exterior.

The website was built to explore:

🔬 Immersive storytelling through UI/UX

💻 Front-end development using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

📱 Modern responsive design

🎮 Web-based simulations of in-universe lore

Whether you're a fan of the Outlast series, a front-end developer, or just curious about what a corporation like Murkoff would look like online — this project is for you.
